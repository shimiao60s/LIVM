### Video and Audio Processing Toolkit

This toolkit processes video files to segment them and extract audio. It leverages TensorFlow to handle TFRecord datasets and uses FFmpeg for video and audio manipulation.

### Features

- Extract specific video IDs based on TensorFlow record datasets.
- Segment videos into smaller clips.
- Extract audio from video segments.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg installed on your system (required for video and audio processing)
